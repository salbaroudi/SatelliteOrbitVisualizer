## Satellite Orbit Visualizer:

### Introduction: 

This is a final project to show the culmination of my software and front-end development skills: a Satellite Orbit Visualizer.

The appliction utilizes the following technologies:

- React (responsive and overall framework, fetch() and Data Store)
- Three.js (for all visualizations and real-time animation)
- Playwrite (for Test Driven Development)
- Typescript (for typed-code and native OOP)
- TSC (for overall transpiliation to CommonJS, to run in browser).
- Github Co-pilot.
- nodemon (for real-time code updating (faster development)).

Simply, the project mines real-time data for GPS and other satellites, and creates a visualization of all objects in space, in which a user can query and interact with.

The stages below will discuss the development cycle milestones.

### Stage 0: Environment setup and Integration:

To get all of the node modules listed above working together, is not a trivial task. 

They were tested in pairs, and then fully integrated together with a trivial UI and visualization, as a proof of concept. The project was integrated as follows:

- First, each package was installed on its own.
- Get React+Redux running on its own.
- React and TypeScript 
- TypeScript and Three.js
- React, TypeScript, Three.js
- React and Playwright
- React, TypeScript, Three.js and Playwright
- React and Nodemon
- React, TypeScript, Three.js, Playwright and Nodemon.






Of particular novel note is the use of Github Co-pilot. I predict that the world will move from 10x $\rightarrow$ 100x development in the next few years. So its good to learn this tool now.
